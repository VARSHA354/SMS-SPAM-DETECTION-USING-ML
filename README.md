# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION-USING-ML

#The number of people using mobile devices increasing day by day. SMS (short message service)
is a text message service available in smartphones as well as basic phones. Therefore, the traffic
of SMS increased drastically. The spam messages also increased. The hackers try to send spam
messages for their financial or business benefits like market growth, lottery ticket information,
credit card information, etc. Therefore, spam classification has special attention. This paper
proposes a hybrid machine learning approach that combines the strengths of Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms for
SMS spam detection. Our approach involves using RF to select the most informative features
and SVM with SGD optimization to classify spam messages. Our results show that the hybrid
approach outperforms individual algorithms, highlighting the benefits of combining machine
learning techniques for SMS spam detection. The SMS spam collection data set is used for
testing the method. The dataset is split into two categories for training and testing the research.
Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a hybrid approach with SVM, RF, and SGD
algorithms for improved spam detection accuracy.
